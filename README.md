# DevOps Practice

- Docker 1 (Building a container, installing packages in container)
- Docker 2 (Modifying container, passing env variables, interacting with GitHub REST API)
- GitHub Actions
- Ansible 1 (Load a NodeJS app, deploy a MySQL server, populate the DB with data from CSV file, setup an endpoint which communicates with DB)
- Ansible 2 (Deploy a MySQL server & populate it with data from CSV on one VM, Load a NodeJS app on another VM which connects to the DB VM, setup an endpoint which communicates with the DB)
